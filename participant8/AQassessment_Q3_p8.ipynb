    "The dataframe loaded above represents **air quality scores** (ranging from 0 to 5, higher scores indicate better air quality) for different cities across the globe. Run the cell to obtain the Shapiro Wilk's test statistic and associated p-value, for the dataset below. \n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, a hypothesis is an educated guess about something in the world around us. Hypothesis testing is a way of testing the validity of results of an experiment by figuring out the odds that the results have happened by chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Shapiro-Wilk test** evaluates a data sample and quantifies how likely it is that the data was drawn from a Normal distribution. The tests assume that that the sample was drawn from a Normal distribution. Technically this is called the null hypothesis, or H0. A threshold level is chosen called alpha, typically 5% (or 0.05), that is used to interpret the p-value and either reject H0 or fail to reject H0. The p-value is the probability that a given result (or a more significant result) would occur under the null hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value is less than the chosen significance threshold, then we say the null hypothesis is **rejected** at the chosen level of significance. If the p-value is not less than the chosen significance threshold, then the evidence is insufficient to support a conclusion. The \"fail to reject\" terminology highlights the fact that the null hypothesis is assumed to be true from the start of the test; if there is a lack of evidence against it, it simply continues to be assumed true."

    "# TASK: \n",
    "A group of environmental scientists were interested in investigating the levels of global air quality. They sampled a set of 810 cities across the globe, and set up a team of local people to assist them in collecting data about air quality index using specialized hardware probes over the course of a year. These hardware probes returned a standardized score ranging from 0 to 5, once the air quality recording was complete (higher scores indicate better air quality). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since prior data from a lot of other environmental phenomena suggests that such data are usually **approximately normally distributed**, the scientists expects the arrangement of the air quality index scores across the cities to be similar. In simple words, (i) they expect most cities to have an average air quality, (ii) the number of cities that have higher and lower than average air quality to be fairly equal, and (iii) a very small (and still roughly equivalent) portion of the cities to have either extremely low or extremely high air quality. In order to test this assumption, they calculated some data statistics you ran above. \n",
